# Revolut_Challenge
This was a challenge given to me during my bootcamp at Propulsion Academy.  The task required SQLite and Python.
The subtasks displayed in this notebook are only concerned with the python part. 

# File Description
Data: folder containing the data files (.csv)
rev-devices.csv -- tells whether the user uses Android or iphone.
rev-notifications.csv -- contains information about how and how often revolut contacted the users
rev-transactions.csv -- contains information about the transaction behaviour of the users
rev-users.csv -- contains user information

Notebooks: Jupyter lab notebooks containing code and markdown to solve the subtasks.
